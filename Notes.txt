TODO:

Integrate current services and daos into hierarchies using interfaces or abstract classes.

Implement Proxy design pattern for some of the services, so not an excessive number of objects are passed to the users at once.

Implement Flyweight design pattern for user roles so duplicate user roles aren't created and stored in the database.

Implement Factory Method design pattern for each object.

Document code using Javadoc.

Fix bugs (voting x2, catch hibernate errors, other exceptions).
